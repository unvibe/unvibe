## What is Unvibe?

Unvibe is a local web application that brings LLM (AI assistant) workflows directly to your projects and files. It runs on your machine, with _the same read access as you_—so it can see your code, docs, and project structure. When writing or changing files, Unvibe **always asks for your permission first**.

Key features:

- **Local-first:** Your code and data never leave your machine by default
- **Web-based UI:** Clean, focused experience in your browser
- **Plugin-powered:** Add context, tools, and smarts with plugins (detects frameworks, linters, docs, test tools, and more)
- **Extensible:** Add your own tools and plugins, or use the growing library
