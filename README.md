## What is Unvibe?

Unvibe is a local web application that brings LLM (AI assistant) workflows directly to your projects and files. It runs on your machine, with _the same read access as you_â€”so it can see your code, docs, and project structure. When writing or changing files, Unvibe **always asks for your permission first**.
