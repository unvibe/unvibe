# Understanding LLMs: A Mental Model

## Let's define some stuff!

Defining terms is crucial for clarity, after all, we are trying to make a "useful" mental model of LLMs so we can use them effectively. Here are some key terms we will use in this document:

First, what's LLM stands for again? Large Language Model let's define each part of that term:

- **Large** we all know what large means, it's the size of the model! ez
- **Language** Here I can dust off my oxford dictionary and say that language is "the method of human communication, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a structured and conventional way." that's an accurate definition, but it's not very useful for our purposes, so let's define language as:

```
a brain integrated communication system, that main purpose is to influence the behavior of other brains.
```

We will use this definition of language throughout this document, and it will help us build a useful mental model.

- **Model** A model is a simplified representation of a system that helps us understand and predict its behavior. In the context of LLMs, a model is a mathematical construct that has been trained on vast amounts of text data to learn patterns, structures, and relationships in language.

It's amazing what brains can do, it's a very flexible world modeling machine, and we can use it to build models of the world around us.

## A good starting point

You as a human being with the super power of language, you wake up in the morning, have a cup of coffee, do your everyday stuff, you have your own daily routine influnced by your the environment around you, but most importantly, you interact lingustically with other humans (and latley with LLMs)

Humans, we know what they want, their goals, their desires, their needs, and we can use this knowledge to build a mental model of how they work, but with the introduction of LLMs, it got confusing for everybody, it was amazing that they even worked.

## Post LLM shock

AI companies like OpenAI and Googles research teams worked hard to build with these models, enhancing them, paving the way for how to build these LLMs systems, giving LLMs the ability to call tools, and experimenting with giving them more abilities, memory, vision, and more. AGI feels very close, but something aint right, we are still not there yet, and we are still trying to figure out how to use these models effectively and explosion of human creativity is unleashed to fulfill the promise of AGI and real world economical value.

- **tool calling**
- language alone isn't enough
- diagrams and visualizations for current state of calling llms
